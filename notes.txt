process improvement

weekly standups

identify the workload for each task
know what the rest is doing

weekly standups:
-what tickets have been completed, work by others, communicated
(get notes from kevin about this)
meet every week-set time. 10am. over the week we do code.
tell everyone what you are working on and what you've done.
quick meeting for formal updates for each other
still update each other on discord
can say it didnt go well and why it went well.
write this in dissertation. mentors propose this and whether we did it or not. whether it was helpful or not.

planning program:
start of each sprint.
come out of client meeting and produce new requirements. add tickets. etc.
assign values to tickets
specialise too deeply.
points system for tickets.
talk about the issues with team.
how important, how long it should take.
issues need to be closed and done on time as indicated.
if not done, need to update the ticket with reason why it was not done. deadline extended.
agree value of the ticket - doesnt have to be exact for each member.
value depends on time - discuss with team which value should be appropriate this ticket should be worked on.
"ticket not done because i was blocked", "found it more difficult than expected."

stand ups - to see how far along you are with what you are working on.
